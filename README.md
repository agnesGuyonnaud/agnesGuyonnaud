# Hi there 👋, I'm Agnès Guyonnaud


## 🚀 About me

- 🎓 Currently a computer engineering student at INSA Lyon (graduating in 2027)
- 💡 Eager to discover everything the tech world has to offer in innovations and opportunities
- 🛠️ Quite broad technical stack (network administration, full stack web development, declarative logical programming, ...)
- 🚀 Always looking for new projects to explore the world of open source software, computer science research, AI, transportation robotics and many other things...

## 💼 Projects and Contributions

- 🗂️ [Portfolio](https://agnesGuyonnaud.github.io)
- 🌱 [Coming soon: AGIR and SMART projects, info listening to society]

I am convinced that a GitHub profile can be a real professional portfolio, illustrating a developer's technical skills and work ethic. I encourage our students to regularly enrich their GitHub profile to demonstrate their progress, projects, and mastery of development standards.
